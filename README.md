This is a Flask(Python) project of Graduate student Originally, this system has some functions,such as destination recommendation and analysis(using KNN), searching hotels, flight tickets, sharing pictures and videos, user management so and so forth! However, some of these functions are developed by our team members. I only share the functions that I developed. INCLUDING: User login, Registration, Reset Password, Edit Personal Information, Sharing and Browsing interesting videos and pictures.

We use MVC(Model-View-Controller) Architecture Design to develop this website. In addition to this, we use the MongoDB to store and process the data.

I got the highest mark when demonstrated this project, and I also wish you can get the highest mark too!
